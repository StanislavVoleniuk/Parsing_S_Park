# Parsing_S_Park
In this notebook, we use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to fully scrape the website Serengeti-Park.de, including menu navigation, collecting all unique text, and clicking on interactive elements like "Mehr" buttons. The goal is to train a bot so it understands the website's structure and knows where each piece of information is located.
